# ProfileMigration
This tool will assist in migrating a local account to an AD account on a recently bound machine.  It will migrate the user home directory, assign administrative rights, and enable FileVault.  

Some applications will need to be reset after migrating, such as DropBox, which save the path to the home directory in settings.
